Specific maintenance actions can help improve biodiversity in low diversity woodlands by generally increasing species, age and structural variety within the woodland itself.

The following actions may be suitable for a site such as the Ponderosa woodland (discussed in previous post) or similar sites suffering from a general lack of biodiversity. Actions may include:

**1. Understorey/Ground Layer Creation:**

<figcaption>(Image source: Forests.co.uk, 2020)</figcaption>

* Would involve establishing forbs (non-grass herbaceous species) within the ground layer
* Could be established by a mix of seed sowing and planting (of containerised plants) to maximise chances of establishment
* Select species with some shade tolerance

{% capture notice-1 %}

#### Rationale:

* Increased shelter and food opportunities for ground fauna, including insects, pollinators and small mammals
* Reduced opportunities for growth of vigorous, low diversity species
* Increased visual interest

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-1 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-2 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Autumn-winter (non icy conditions), year 1
* Could be repeated following each coppice cycle (e.g. every 5 years - assuming evaluation of success of previous planting)

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>


{% capture notice-3 %}

#### Where:

* Open areas of woodland (e.g. recently coppiced areas)

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-3 | markdownify }}
</div>

<br>
**2. Rotational coppicing**

<img src="/assets/images/urban countryman2 2012.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption>Coppice stool left from coppicing (Image source: Urban Countryman, 2012)</figcaption>

* Would involve cutting trees close to the ground for them to regrow with additional shoots from its base
* Rotational coppicing means only a specific % of woodland is to be coppiced at any one time
* Favours species tolerant to coppicing (not all are tolerant)
* Waste materials (coppice, brash) can be reused on site
* Could involve locals/volunteers in coppicing as educational training 


{% capture notice-4 %}

#### Rationale:

* Increased age diversity of woodland
* Allows more light to reach the woodland floor - providing ideal conditions for pollinator friendly plants to grow
* Increased habitat opportunities for woodland edge butterflies, other insects/pollinators, and small mammals
* Rotational coppicing means there will always be access to habitat for species that may favour older coppice stands
* Coppicing of existing dominant species can help allow newly introduced species to develop for biodiversity
* Educational and social value from involvement of locals/volunteers

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-4 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-5 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* To occur on a rotational coppice cycle (e.g. every 2 years, 15% of trees could be coppiced, with a single stand coppiced a minimum of every 6 years)
* Longer cycles may favour certain species (e.g. dormice), whilst shorter cycles may favour others (e.g. butterflies)

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-5 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-6 %}

#### Where:

* Where there are groups of existing (low diversity) dominant tree species
* Areas of dense tree planting forming dense shade

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-6 | markdownify }}
</div>

<br>
**3. Thinning**

<img src="/assets/images/ponderosa2teaser.JPG" alt="">
<figcaption>Dense areas of holly within the Ponderosa woodland, Sheffield</figcaption>

* Would involve the thinning of vigorous non-diverse shrub species (e.g. bramble/holly), and dominant tree saplings
* Could involve partial or complete removal of species from the vicinity 
* Partial removal (e.g. 60% rather than 100%) could favour species like bramble, which do have some value to wildlife
* Large areas will favour volunteer involvement


{% capture notice-7 %}

#### Rationale:
* To break up monocultures, allowing other species to establish for increased biodiversity

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-7 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-8 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Autumn-winter, year 1
* Could be repeated every 5 years or more/less as required to allow new species to establish

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-8 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-9 %}

#### Where:

* Areas dominated by monocultures of vigorous shrubs or saplings

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-9 | markdownify }}
</div>



<br>
**4. New Tree Planting**

<img src="/assets/images/tree planting.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption>(Image source: WTML, unknown date)</figcaption>

* Would involve establishing new tree species into the woodland
* Could include the planting of saplings and small sized trees (e.g. light standards) to maximise chances of establishment
* Species may require staking or animal protection (e.g. rabbit guards), depending on size and location
* Hand digging for any excavations will minimise compaction of soils and damage to neighbouring tree roots

{% capture notice-10 %}

#### Rationale:

* To increase the species diversity of woodland
* To reduce the overall % of dominant species on site
* Provides a wider range of food sources and habitat for insects, pollinators, small mammals and birds etc.
* Increased visual interest from increased tree species variety


{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-10 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-11 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Autumn-winter (non icy conditions), year 1
* Sapling planting to supplement thinning (action 3), every 5 years until a more diverse mix has been established

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-11 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-12 %}

#### Where:

* Areas occupied by dominant species

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-12 | markdownify }}
</div>

<br>
**5. Bulb Planting**

<img src="/assets/bulb planting.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption>Bulb planting using a grid (Image source: S. Uyterhoeven, 2009)</figcaption>

* Would involve planting bulbs in groups within the woodland
* Species selected to have some shade tolerance
* Could involve locals/volunteers in community bulb planting


{% capture notice-13 %}

#### Rationale:

* To provide a longer period of flowering for pollinators
* Visual interest for people
* Educational and social value when involving locals 

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-13 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-14 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Autumn, year 1 (for early flowering bulbs)
* Bulb planting could be repeated every 5 years if presence is no longer prominent

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-14 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-15 %}

#### Where:

* Site-wide, but especially adjacent to woodland paths

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-15 | markdownify }}
</div>

<br>
**6. Tree Veterenisation**

<img src="/assets/tree vet edit.PNG" alt="">
<figcaption>Tree veterenisation techniques, mainly using chainsaws (Image source: V. Bengtsson, 2012)</figcaption>

* To involve damaging existing trees to form holes, crevices and cuts, in most cases without killing the tree
* Experimentation of damaging trees to be promoted to maximise variety
* Skilled work - requires a qualified arboriculturist is employed 
* Can involve use of chainsaws, axes and a variety of other tools for damage variety
* To occur to only a small % of trees (<5%), with dominant species with a suitable girth prioritised

{% capture notice-16 %}

#### Risks:
Risks include the increased potential for trees or tree limbs to fall, potentially putting the health of people at risk. Risks may be reduced by:

* Locating any veterenisation away from pedestrian routes (or use)
* Removal of potential dangerous dangling limbs from veteranised trees

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-16 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-17 %}

#### Rationale:

* To simulate habitat that may typically be found in an older, more developed woodland
* Increasing amount of dead/decaying habitat for bats, birds, deadwood invertebrates, fungi and lichens

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-17 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-18 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Autumn-winter, year 1
* Could be repeated at low frequencies (eg. every 5-10 years)

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-18 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-19 %}

#### Where:

* Away from pedestrian areas
* To existing dominant tree species

{% endcapture %}

    <figcaption>Vertical log pile, and hibernacula (Image sources: PTES, 2014 and Raymond Brown, 2020) </figcaption>
</figure>

* To involve creating man-made structures to provide habitat for wildlife
* Primarily through the reuse of waste materials from site maintenance (logs, brash, coppice etc.)
* Can involve local schools and volunteers in construction - ideally led by an ecologist
* Structures can include: brash piles, vertical log piles, hibernacula, bird/bat boxes and bug hotels


{% capture notice-20 %}

#### Rationale:

* To provide habitat for insects, deadwood invertebrates, solitary bees, reptiles, small mammals, birds etc.
* Minimises carbon/energy used from transporting waste materials off site
* Educational and social value when by local schools and volunteers

{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-20 | markdownify }}
</div>

{% capture notice-21 %}

#### When/frequency: 

* Winter, year 1 following coppicing/thinning
* Structures can be ‘topped up’ or built as maintenance occurs

{% endcapture %}

In the next post I shall discuss potential future scenarios where perhaps certain actions have not been as effective as intended - along with some considerations and potential solutions.
