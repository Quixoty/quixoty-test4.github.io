Some tree species have more problems with pests and diseases than others. In species selection, make sure to check whether the tree species in question has any prominent pests/diseases, and if so, consider choosing another species, or find a cultivar immune/resistant to the disease in question. 

<p style="text-align: justify;">

It is generally a good idea to have a variety of tree species on site so if any pests/diseases do infect a specific tree species, not all the trees are influenced.

When sourcing the trees, ideally use reputable UK grown tree suppliers to minimise the chances of diseased stock infecting trees on site.
