It is the 23rd August 2020, and **Landscape Design Tips** is now live.


**Landscape Design Tips** aims to provide a clear and thorough compendium of tips, guides and thoughts, to help inform and provide inspiration to those with an interest in landscape design - be it on the scale of a small garden or a large residential project.

For useful tools and resources to aid you in the design process, please refer to the sidebar with external links to the left hand side of the page.

Keep an eye out for new weekly posts, as well as the monthly photograph competition for readers.

The next winners will be announced on **30th September 2020** for the theme **ponds or waterbodies**. Winners will have their photos added to the [Precedent Gallery][precedent-gallery].
