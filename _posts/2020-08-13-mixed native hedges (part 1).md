Introduction
A mixed native hedge (or hedge) is dense linear green feature made up of native shrub and/or tree species, and is commonly seen throughout the UK as boundaries to fields, and open spaces. Though specification, maintenance and species selection, the mixed native hedge is a very versatile tool that can provide a multitude of positive benefits and services within the landscape both to humans and wildlife alike.

In this series of posts, I shall discuss the value of hedges to both wildlife and people - considering how to maximise the potential benefits through species selection, maintenance and specification of the hedge. To conclude I shall then discuss the future of the mixed hedges within the landscape in response to the changing UK climate.

So what value does a mixed native hedge offer within the landscape – and how can we maximise it?

Value to wildlife
There is no doubt that mixed native hedges are beneficial to ecology. They can provide food through berries and nuts for birds and mammals, as well as food for pollinators as the hedge flowers. Foliage provides shelter and allows wildlife to safely move throughout the hedge.

To maximise the ecological value of proposed hedges consider:
* Planting and maintaining as thicker hedges (especially thicker to the base of the hedge), to provide greater sheltering opportunities, as well preventing damage to the base of the hedge 
* Getting as much species variety within the hedge as possible, to maximise the timespan in which food sources are available for wildlife, as well as providing food for a greater variety of species, and providing a more disease and pest resilient hedge. Consider tailoring the hedge species mix should you wish to encourage specific species of wildlife.
* Connect proposed hedges to existing green elements to create a strong green biodiverse network to allow wildlife to freely move.
* Retain, enhance and supplement existing mixed hedges where required. Where species diversity is low, or large gaps have formed in existing hedges, additional mixed hedge planting could be beneficial. 
* Remember to avoid any hedge maintenance in the bird nesting season (bird nesting season is between February – August)

Whilst providing these benefits for wildlife may not be considered important or a priority for clients or developers, it is important to consider that an increased value to wildlife has a knock on effect resulting on increased value to humans – as increased habitat and food sources for pollinators aids pollination and consequently crop yield in the context of agriculture, and orchards for example.
