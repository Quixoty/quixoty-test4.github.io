Trees planted in urban areas are likely to be exposed to the air pollution produced by motor vehicles. 

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Pollutants include Sulphur dioxide and Nitrogen dioxide which can contribute to lower rates of photosynthesis in trees, resulting in lower growth rates. 

<br>

Choosing trees tolerant to these chemicals can mitigate the harm done and increase their chances of survival.

<br>

Below is an extract from the book Tree Roots in the Built Environment in which some tree species are catagorised according to their tolerance to pollution.
