<BR>
  
Each month there will be competition for readers to send in a photograph they have taken for inclusion in the **Precedent Gallery**

The next winner will be announced on 30th September 2020 – with the theme  ‘XYZ’, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled when you’re out and about.

The rules for this competition are that the photograph:
* is related to the theme
* has been taken by yourself relatively recently
* does not include yourself in the photo

Make sure to send your photos through to landscapedesigntips@outlook.com along with your first (and/or last) name should you want to be credited.
