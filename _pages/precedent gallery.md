    title: "Good Precedent: This tree has clearly been regularly maintained to control its size and is a good example of how regular maintenance and species selection has allowed for healthy tree growth. There is no apparent damage to hard landscape despite the confined dimensions of the planter, and proximity to buildings."

    title: "Bad Precedent: Whilst the tree forms an attractive sizable green element within the streetscape, it is clear there is not enough space for the roots. When considering existing trees within newly designed landscapes, make sure to consider their proximity to hard surfaces and structures. By giving trees (proposed and existing) the space they need and not restricting them to confined spaces, damage to hard landscape elements is less of a risk."

    title: "Bad Precedent: Possibly too much shading and overcrowding from trees and vigorous pond plants, which can reduce the overall biodiversity of the pond."
