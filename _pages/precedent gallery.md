    alt: "Good Precedent (Tree in Planter)"
    title: "Good Precedent: This tree has clearly been regularly maintained to control its size and is a good example of how regular maintenance and species selection has allowed for healthy tree growth. There is no apparent damage to hard landscape despite the confined dimensions of the planter, and proximity to buildings."

    alt: "Bad Precedent (Tree in Planter)"
    title: "Bad Precedent: Whilst the tree forms an attractive sizable green element within the streetscape, it is clear there is not enough space for the roots. When considering existing trees within newly designed landscapes, make sure to consider their proximity to hard surfaces and structures. By giving trees (proposed and existing) the space they need and not restricting them to confined spaces, damage to hard landscape elements is less of a risk."

    alt: "Good Precedent (Pond)"
    title: "Good Precedent: An attractive pond with diverse pond vegetation and not too much shade - aiding the overall pond biodiversity."

    image_path: /assets/images/badprecedentpond.jpg
    alt: "Bad Precedent (Pond)"
    title: "Bad Precedent: Possibly too much shading and overcrowding from trees and vigorous pond plants, which can reduce the overall biodiversity of the pond."

    alt: "Good Precedent (Wall)"
    title: "Good Precedent: An attractive wall with a pleasant non-uniform colour due to moss and staining."

    image_path: /assets/images/badprecedentwall.JPG
    alt: "Bad Precedent (Wall)"
    title: "Bad Precedent: Unattractive wall with damaged concrete panels, low quality graffiti, and barbed wire. Perhaps with repair/replacement of broken panels as well as some high quality graffiti/art, this wall could become a more attractive feature?"

  - url: /assets/images/goodsetts.JPG
    image_path: /assets/images/goodsetts.JPG
    alt: "Good Precedent (Setts)"
    title: "Good Precedent: Appearance of setts are enhanced by moss growth in the joints creating an interesting and attractive hard/soft feature."
  - url: /assets/images/badsetts.JPG
    image_path: /assets/images/badsetts.JPG
    alt: "Bad Precedent (Setts)"
    title: "Bad Precedent: Unnattractive, and inconsistently poured concrete between these setts has resulted in a poor transition from the 2 adjacent block paving types"

{% include gallery id="gallery1" layout="half" caption="Examples of a **good** (left) and **bad** (right) precedent. The bad precedent has a large proportion of the pond area covered in shade and vigorous pond plants, which can contribute to reduced pond biodiversity." %}

**August 2020 - Trees in Raised Planters**


{% include gallery id="gallery" layout="half" caption="Examples of a **good** (left) and **bad** (right) precedent. The bad precedent has too little available rooting volume for the tree, resulting in damage to the masonry." %}
